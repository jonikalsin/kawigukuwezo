This is so because the latter showed her interest in playing golf at the tender age of six after being brought up by her mother, who was a professional golf player. She groomed her career at such a young age, and by the time she was completing her high school, she had earned a couple of awards as a golf player. You might want to know more about her.</p><h2>Holly Sonders biography</h2><h3>Holly Sonders age</h3><p class=align-left>How old is Holly Sonders?

The latter is presumed to have inherited her skill from her mother, who is a professional golfer and has been a champion in the sport for twenty-two years. She started showing interests in the sport at the age of six, and her parents were supportive in helping her nurture her passion.</p><p class=align-left>Her father is an optometrist who has been supportive throughout the career of his wife and daughter. Holly also has a brother, but very little is known about him.</p><h3>Holly Sonders education</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4b5cc4e25f5cd491.jpg><p class=align-left>Apart from nurturing her golfing skills at the tender age of six, very little is known about Holly's early childhood life. She, however, attended Marysville High School for her high school after which she enrolled at the Michigan State University where she pursued a bachelors degree in journalism. In 2009, she graduated with a major in journalism.</p><h3>Holly Sonders spouse</h3><p class=align-left>The latter is currently dating Kliff Kingsbury. Kliff is the leading coach of Arizona Cardinals. She, however, was married to Erick Kuselias, who is a radio and TV host. The two are alleged to have dated for some time before they got married. They, later on, divorced even though the reasons behind the divorce are not known.</p><h4><strong>The divorce</strong></h4><p class=align-left>News of their engagement went up in 2012. The news caught everyone by surprise as there were no speculations that they had been dating. During this period, Holly shared a photo of her fiance on her Twitter account and seemed to have been living her best life. She was also seen in public places with her husband after they had gotten married, and they seemed to have been serving the internet with relationship goals until when the relationship hit rock bottom.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, the two love birds parted ways. The divorce was also kept low-key, just as they had done to their dating life. Holly Sonders, however, came out to admit that they were no longer together. In a Twitter post, she stated:</p>I filed for divorce over a year agoâ€¦we have not been together in a very long time. Thanks.<p class=align-left>After the breakup, she came out to state that she needed some time to be alone and patch up a couple of things.</p><h4><strong>Dating Coach Kliff Kingsbury</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The speculation of the two being together came up in January 2019 after she shared a video of the coach's promotion on her Twitter account to congratulate him. The caption of the post read:</p>The desert just got a whole lot hotter. Congratulations @KliffKingsbury, so proud of you,<p class=align-left>As though that was not enough, the message was accompanied by love emojis. That got the internet questioning whether something was brewing between the two. One of the followers was bold enough and retweeted:</p>Someone has a crush.<p class=align-left>Her response to the comment confirmed the speculations as she retweeted saying that she has always had a crush on Kliff and that they were beyond just having a crush.</p><h3>Holly Sonders golf career</h3><p class=align-left>Holly's career began at the tender age of six, and she perfected the skill while in high school.
