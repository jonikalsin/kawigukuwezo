Neighbours wary of plan to turn mansion into celebrity zoo members club</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Founded by Englishman Nick Jones in 1995 as a hub for creatives, Soho House now attracts famous names such as former One Direction frontman Harry Styles at its global locations.</p><p>Melbourne City Council is obliged to make an initial decision on the proposal, lodged in November, by March next year.</p><p>The consortium – which is already converting the Sorrento Continental Hotel on the Mornington Peninsula into a five-star resort – bought Poolman House for about $20 million in February.</p><p>The six-bedroom, five-bathroom property was available for lease at $10,000 per week earlier this year. It has a ballroom, tennis court, swimming pool and chandelier-adorned dining room.</p><p>The developers declined to comment when contacted by The Age on Wednesday.</p><p>David Parker, a local resident and Melbourne South Yarra Residents Group committee member, said he was worried the proposal would increase congestion in what he called a village-like area of South Yarra.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.757%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_126%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/ff091434a88f4a3f2f29f2d9314a4c837d45344a><p>“I think it would throw the whole balance of the area to suddenly have a licensed facility that opens at 7am and closes at 3am on weekends,” said Mr Parker, a filmmaker.</p><p>“I have been to Soho Houses in New York and Los Angeles. It can be a zoo on the street with paparazzi and fans when celebrities are inside.”</p><p>Gayle Gledhill, president of the residents’ group, said the plans were a community concern.</p><p>“We are keen to see that an area zoned as residential remains residential in its nature and usage,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.738%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/7c7ecf4df376b458eb9faf8c5a041ba033f8ff7a><p>The planning documents point to a conference centre across the road from Poolman House and the neighbouring Italian Culture Institute as examples of commercial use nearby.</p><p>The proposal will be referred to a Melbourne City Council planning committee if there are more than 16 objections. The property, on the corner of high-traffic Punt Road, sits just outside the boundaries of Stonnington Council.</p><p>Memberships that cover visiting every Soho House worldwide start at about $2700 plus a sign-on fee of about $900.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.726%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/775f941657d6950239705a1b7260328f251a7e2d><p>Speaking shortly before Soho House Hong Kong opened in 2019, founder Mr Jones said he would open venues in Melbourne and Sydney simultaneously.</p><p>“If I’m going that far, I might as well do both places. I don’t want to piss them off, there’s a lot of competition between the two. We learnt that from doing Barcelona before Madrid,” he told Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Soho House in Manhattan, New York, became infamous in 2010 when swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay was found dead in a bath. Her ex-boyfriend Nicholas Brooks was convicted of murder, with a documentary about the incident released in 2015.</p><p><strong>Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week. <a href=#>Sign up to get our new Explainer newsletter here</a>.</strong></p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6S1sHnOq2Snp12cvG66xKKeoZqfqr%2B0edaaqbJln5t6sbjAp2Stp12pwrO6jKaYp6uZpLtutc2tpmablaGyo77IrbBmsp%2Bkeq6xzJucq6tdmLm2ro4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
