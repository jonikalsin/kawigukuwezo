AnnaSophia is a model, singer and actress, perhaps best known for being a part of film projects including “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Race to Witch Mountain”. She’s been active in the entertainment industry since 2004, and all of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is AnnaSophia Robb? As of early-2018, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $4.5 million, mostly earned through a successful career in acting. She’s also appeared in numerous television projects, and has won several awards over the course of her career. As she continues working, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>AnnaSophia Robb Net Worth $4.5 million</h3><p>AnnaSophia grew up being home schooled, and started to gain an interest in acting after performing at her local church. She did gymnastics and dance, but soon focused on pursuing an acting career. She would later attend and matriculate from Arapahoe High School, and then enrolled at New York University.</p><p>At the age of nine, Robb went to several auditions in Los Angeles and would appear in commercials for Bratz and McDonalds, which would lead her to gain a small role in the television series “Drake & Josh”. Her first major role would be as a title character in the television special entitled “Samantha: An American Girl Holiday”. Soon, more opportunities would come her way which would increase her net worth, especially playing parts in film adaptations of popular children’s books, including “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Because of Winn-Dixie”. She then voiced a guest character in the animated series “Danny Phantom”, before modelling for Trad Clothing. She also recorded a song entitled “Keep Your Mind Wide Open”, which was showcased on the Disney Channel. Her net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>AnnaSophia would continue to appear in numerous films, including “Jumper”, “The Reaping”, “Will Travel” and “Spy School”, and earned praise for her performance in “Sleepwalking” despite the film’s negative reviews. In 2009, she starred in the film “Race to Witch Mountain”, and would then star in “Soul Surfer” portraying Bethany Hamilton, who is a surfer who lost her arm after a shark attack. In 2011, AnnaSophia was cast in the film “Pan” but she soon dropped out of the project, but then had the role of Carrie Bradshaw in the “Sex and the City” prequel entitled “The Carrie Diaries”. A few of her latest projects include “The Crash” in which she appears alongside <a href=#>John Leguizamo</a>, and she also appeared in the TV drama series “Mercy Street” in the role of Alice Green.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Robb has had relationships with <a href=#>Colton Haynes</a>, <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a>, <a href=#>Alexander Ludwig</a> and Chris Wood, but is still single. She does charity work, and also appeared as a part of the “2017 Women’s March”. She also mentioned in an interview that she is a Christian.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.509871668312><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>AnnaSophia Robb</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 8, 1993</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Denver, Colorado, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.52 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>New York University, Arapahoe High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Janet Robb, David Robb</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/annasophiarobb</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/robbannasophia</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://plus.google.com/+AnnaSophiaRobb</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/annasophiarobb/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1455681/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Young Hollywood Award for Female Superstar of Tomorrow</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>BFCA Critics' Choice Award for Best Young Actress, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star, Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama</td></tr><tr readability=23><td>Movies</td><td>Bridge to Terabithia, Soul Surfer, The Carrie Diaries, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Race to Witch Mountain, The Way, Way Back, Because of Winn-Dixie, The Reaping, Jack of the Red Hearts, Jumper, The Crash, West Texas Lullaby, Mercy Street, Spy School, Freak Show, Khumba, Down a Dark Hall, The ...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Carrie Diaries</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=28.313603662525><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Prom was awesome.
