Tragically, the cause of Ethan’s punishment was for “not knowing 13 Bible verses to Timothy’s satisfaction.”</p><p>The reckless behavior of the two adults, alongside their teenage son, has now officially been found to be criminal. All three are expected to make their first court appearances in Manitowoc County court today.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-204631 alt="Ethan Hauschultz" width=600 height=912 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ethan-hauschultz-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-204631 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Fox 11 News</span><span class=caption-body>Ethan Hauschultz</span></p><p>Timothy is charged with felony murder and felony contributing to the delinquency of a child, and four other charges. Tina is charged with failing to prevent bodily harm and intentionally contributing to the delinquency of a child, while their son Damian is charged with first-degree reckless homicide, and six additional charges.</p><p>Damian told police that his father picked out the logs for Ethan and that he was ordered by his father to make sure the boy completed his daily punishment. Though Damian is not yet of age, juveniles in Wisconsin charged with certain homicides are processed in adult court.</p><p>“Ethan had been performing punishment ordered by Timothy which required Ethan to carry a heavy wooden log, weighing approximately two-thirds his body weight, while being monitored by Timothy’s 15-year-old son,” the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office said.</p><p>While it would seem as though Damian, only a 15-year-old child himself, could’ve been coerced into the dangerous, negligent behavior of his, investigators found evidence to the contrary.</p><p>The teenager allegedly kicked and struck Ethan around 100 times, sometimes using a stick or belt. He even stood on the boy’s chest while his face was in a puddle, and buried him in snow for more than 20 minutes without a coat or boots on. This would explain the signs of blunt force trauma on the boy’s body, with hypothermia being the ultimate cause of death.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-204605 alt="Manitowoc County Sheriff's Office" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manitowoc-county-sheriffs-department.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-204605 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Tony Webster/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>Manitowoc County Sherriff’s Office</span></p><p>Damian told police that he “didn’t do anything that would have hurt” Ethan, yet admitted to the above series of events and described covering Ethan “in his own little coffin of snow.”</p><p>Timothy, meanwhile, explained to investigators that carrying the heavy log was meant to instill discipline. He also said that he wasn’t home when Ethan died. Damian allegedly called his father several times when he realized Ethan was no longer moving.</p><p>Tina has yet to make any substantial statements in this case, with Monday’s court hearing likely to clarify her role in the matter. One of Ethan’s siblings told police that she was well aware of Timothy’s grueling punishment methods — which certainly substantiates charges alleging failure of preventing bodily harm and intentionally contributing to the delinquency of a child.</p><p>After learning about the tragic death of Ethan Hauschultz, read about the <a href=#>parents who starved their son to death</a> as part of a 40-day religious fast.
