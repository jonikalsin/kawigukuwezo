The economic cataclysm would hit the nation's largest city particularly hard.<p>An unemployed man reads a newspaper in his shanty, 1933.</p></span><span class=credit>FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>An unemployed man lies down on the city docks, circa 1935.</span><span class=credit>Lewis Hine/National Archives and Records Administration via Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>Much of Central Park became Hooverville, a shanty town for the newly impoverished (named for President Herbert Hoover, in office during the market crash and widely blamed for it) -- pictured above, 1933.</span><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>An old woman receives her Thanksgiving ration of food as other hungry people wait in line for the same, 1930.</span><span class=credit>Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Yet amid all this poverty and desperation, certain aspects of New York thrived during the Great Depression. Throughout those ten or so years, it in many ways became the city we know today.<p>Pictured: The most famous image of the many high-profile New York construction projects of the Great Depression depicts laborers taking their lunch break on a steel beam atop the 70-story RCA building in Rockefeller Center, more than 800 feet above the street, on September 20, 1932.</p></span><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>While the true roots of the Great Depression in America are varied and complex, the simplified version of the story begins on "Black Thursday," October 24, 1929. At this point, fears of dangerously rampant speculation saw stockholders dump their assets at record numbers, with the market losing a whopping 11 percent of its value on that one day.<p>Pictured: Traders work on Wall Street in October 1929.</p></span><span class=credit>OFF/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Just four days after "Black Thursday" came "Black Monday" and "Black Tuesday," when the market lost a further 13 and 12 percent, respectively, of its value. It was, all things considered, the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States.<p>Pictured: Upset crowds gather outside the New York Stock Exchange soon after the crash.</p></span><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span> <span class=caption-body>Soon after the crash, tens of millions across the country sank into poverty. And in New York, by 1932, "half of [the city's] manufacturing plants were closed, one in every three New Yorkers was unemployed, and roughly 1.6 million were on some form of relief," according to the New York Tenement Museum.<p>Unemployed men sit outside their makeshift homes in lower Manhattan, 1935.</p></span><span class=credit>Berenice Abbott/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>Within six months of the crash, more than 50 breadlines served meals to approximately 50,000 hungry people each day in the Lower East Side alone.<p>Pictured: A long line of unemployed and homeless men wait outside to get free dinner at a municipal lodging house, circa 1930.</p></span><span class=credit>Fotosearch/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>A woman pulls her baggage as she pushes her baby in a pram, circa early 1930s.</span><span class=credit>Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Talman Street in northwest Brooklyn, 1936.</span><span class=credit>Berenice Abbott/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>Children play in the gutter in the southern section of the Bronx, 1936.</span><span class=credit>Russell Lee/Library of Congress</span> <span class=caption-body>The Manhattan Bridge as seen from Pike and Henry Streets, littered with trash, 1936.</span><span class=credit>Berenice Abbott/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>A child sits on the fire escape of the tenement in which she lives, circa mid-1930s.</span><span class=credit>Consuelo Kanaga/Brooklyn Museum via Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>A large group of people wait on a food line, 1932.</span><span class=credit>National Archives and Records Administration via Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>A man stands beside his traveling tin shop in Brooklyn, 1936.</span><span class=credit>Berenice Abbott/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>A vacant lot in the southern section of the Bronx, 1936.</span><span class=credit>Russell Lee/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>Unemployed men smoke cigarettes amid their shantytown in lower Manhattan, 1935.</span><span class=credit>Berenice Abbott/New York Public Library</span> <span class=caption-body>However, while poverty plunged New York to new depths, the city's ambitious construction projects pushed it to new heights.

The city's first ever mayor of either southern or eastern European descent, he unified the city's poor immigrant populations (most of which came from that region).

Roosevelt, he also enacted scores of social and economic relief programs.<p>Pictured: LaGuardia giving a radio broadcast, 1940.</p></span><span class=credit>Fred Palumbo/Library of Congress</span> <span class=caption-body>Ultimately, the Great Depression exposed just how bad poverty in much of the city had already been for decades. In response, LaGuardia's initiatives saw thousands of slums and tenements fixed, torn down, or rebuilt, making way for a newer, better New York that would see extraordinary economic growth in the coming decades.<p>Pictured: Lower Manhattan, circa 1931.</p></span><span class=credit>U.S. National Archives via Wikimedia Commons</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt=Rations src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/rations.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 55 Harrowing Photos Of The Great Depression In New York City View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>Today, we simply can't truly appreciate the magnitude of the Great Depression.</p><p>Just nine years ago, the United States fell to its knees as the housing market went bust, Detroit collapsed, and Wall Street crumbled, marking the start of the Great Recession. Within just two years, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubled, reaching a whopping ten percent in 2009.</p><p>The crisis went worldwide and ultimately became the worst global recession since World War II. But none of it held a candle to the Great Depression.</p><p>During the Great Recession, the worldwide GDP fell by less than one percent. During the Great Depression, that fall was 15 times worse. And in the U.S. in particular, unemployment during the Great Depression increased not by a mere factor of two, but by a factor of six, ultimately hitting historic highs of about 25 percent in 1933.</p><p>The trouble began in earnest four years earlier with the Wall Street crashes of September and October 1929. Fueled by excessive stock speculation and shaky banking standards unequipped to handle those investments, the crash plunged the U.S. and the rest of the Western industrialized world into the worst economic cataclysm in modern history.</p><p>And perhaps no place in America felt the effects of the Great Depression worse than the place where it at least nominally started: New York City.</p><p>For decades before the crash, both European immigrants and domestic rural migrants had been flooding into New York, causing the city's population to double between 1900 and 1930. With so many new people â€” many of them impoverished to begin with â€” pouring in, New York's housing and job prospects were shaky to say the least even before the crash.</p><p>And when the crash came, the results were devastating. In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">words of the New York Tenement Museum</a>:</p><p>"By 1932, half of New York's manufacturing plants were closed, one in every three New Yorkers was unemployed, and roughly 1.6 million were on some form of relief. The city was unprepared to deal with this crisis."</p><p>Yet the city, under the leadership of Mayor Fiorello Laguardia, ultimately proved well prepared to respond to the crisis. To say nothing of his administration's work relief programs, LaGuardia's housing initiatives shut down 10,000 decrepit tenements (more than half of which lacked central heating and toilets) and forced landlords to upgrade another 30,000.</p><p>In the end, the Great Depression served to expose the relatively hidden wounds that had been festering in New York for years â€” or at least force the powers that be to do something about them. And with those wounds cleaned out, the city was able to rebuild into something stronger and become, in many ways, the New York we know today.</p><p>Next, see <a href=#>how the Great Depression crippled the entire nation</a> and <a href=#>African-Americans in particular</a>.
