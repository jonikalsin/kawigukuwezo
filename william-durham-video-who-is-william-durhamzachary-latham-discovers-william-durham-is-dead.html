The origins of this feud can be traced back to Latham’s alleged reckless driving, which had caused tension and frustration within the Durham family. Fuel was added to the fire when Latham took to social media, using platforms like TikTok to taunt and mock the Durhams. This ongoing animosity created a volatile atmosphere, setting the stage for the deadly altercation that would later occur.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Altercation_and_Stabbing></span>Physical Altercation and Stabbing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=internal-link>See more : <span class=waslinkname>Selfie Video Ghanaian Police Officer Having With The Prisoners: “I will be more mindful of my conduct”</span></p><p>On that fateful day, tensions reached a boiling point when Catherine Durham, William’s wife, accused Latham of endangering their teenage son’s life by swerving his car towards him while he was riding his bike. This accusation sparked a physical confrontation between the two parties. In the heat of the moment, Latham swatted at Catherine’s phone, inadvertently making contact with her and further escalating the violence.</p><p>The situation took a terrifying turn when Latham retreated to his home, only to reemerge armed with a stun gun and a knife. In stark contrast, the Durhams were unarmed and defenseless. Latham, driven by anger and aggression, swung his knife at one of the Durham sons, who narrowly evaded the blade. However, without any warning, Latham viciously stabbed William Durham Sr. in the back and left underarm, inflicting severe injuries that would tragically prove fatal.</p><p>In the aftermath of the incident, Latham claimed self-defense, citing a concussion sustained during the brawl. However, the evidence presented during the trial painted a different picture. The jury carefully considered the facts and ultimately found Latham guilty of reckless manslaughter, aggravated assault, and weapons offenses. As a result, he was handed a 15-year prison sentence, marking the end of a harrowing chapter in the lives of both families involved.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trial_and_Verdict></span>Trial and Verdict<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charges_and_Dismissals></span>Charges and Dismissals<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=internal-link>See more : <span class=waslinkname>Sheynnis Palacios Parents: Who Are They?
