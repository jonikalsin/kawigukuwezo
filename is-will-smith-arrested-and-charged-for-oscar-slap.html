A widely circulated rumor claims that the actor has been arrested and charged by the Los Angeles Police Department for his actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Will-Smith-Oscar-Wi-1.jpg><h2>Will Smith Has Not Been Arrested</h2><p>Several fans have come to believe false reports that Will was arrested and charged with slapping Chris. However, as of Wednesday (March 30), no legal action had been taken against the actor because he refused to file a complaint. According to the police, “the individual involved has declined to file a police report.” “If the involved party wishes to obtain a police report at a later time, the LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.” Furthermore, Chris has not addressed the incident or acknowledged Will’s Instagram apology.</p><h2>What Did Jim Carrey Have To Say?</h2><p>Some have even misconstrued Jim Carrey’s statement on Will, assuming that the Liar Liar star was suing him. Jim discussed the incident with Gayle King during an interview.</p><p>“I’d have announced this morning that I was suing Will for $200 million because that video is going to be there forever; it’s going to be ubiquitous,” he explained. That insult will sting for a long time.”</p><p>However, contrary to popular belief, the actor did not state that he was suing Will. Jim only stated that if he had been in Chris’ shoes, he would have taken action against the actor.</p><h2>Apology For Actor Issues</h2><p>Will apologized to Chris, the Academy, and all viewers for his “unacceptably inappropriate” behavior during the award ceremony.</p><p>“Violence in all its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at the Academy Awards last night was both unacceptable and inexcusable. It’s part of the job to make fun of me, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear, and I reacted emotionally,” he said.</p><p>“I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he said before adding, “I would like to publicly apologize to you.” I was out of line, and I was mistaken. I’m embarrassed, and my actions did not reflect the man I want to be.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWnnrmtedKmoK2gXZa%2Fs7HSrZydZZGjsW6vx5qpoJ2UYrOwvoyoqpyZomLAra3PaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
