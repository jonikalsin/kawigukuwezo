And this is what the three-time major winner had to say (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">h/t Sports Illustrated</a>).</p><p>“If you’re talking about in general and not just this event, you know, I think there’s a number of guys that are missed. But I think DJ being maybe the first one to go over there and somebody who never was really controversial over here and more so just kind of worked his butt off, it paid off, got his breakthrough at the U.S. Open, then went and won The Masters.</p><p>“Just a Hall of Fame player that didn’t create controversy with any other players and played on a bunch of Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup teams. Represented ’em really well. He was a friend of mine. He is a friend of mine. I just haven’t seen him.”</p><p>Spieth went on to say how much everyone simply enjoyed being around Johnson, both on and off the course, and discussed the joys of competing against one of the best players in the world.</p><p>And make no mistake about it. Johnson is still that. While he’s dropped to 46th in the world rankings as LIV Golf doesn’t get OWGR points at this time, DJ played some of the best golf of his career in 2022, recording seven top-10 finishes in eight starts, including two individual victories.</p><p>But it won’t be long before we see Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson together again, as both will tee it up at <a href=#>The Masters</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoJ22rXnMopqknZyovK95w66qraGeYrewtM2spqdlkaOxbrnOq5xmq6Wovaa6w56bZpqpYsGpsYypnppn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
