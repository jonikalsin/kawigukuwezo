He is not currently with the team, as he took a leave of absence and is currently not able to access team facilities or activities, even though he is enrolled in online classes at Memphis.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Lawsuits and a Comeback&nbsp;</h2><p>Williams was reportedly ordered to stand trial on the six felony gun charges levied against him, with the arraignment date scheduled for later this year. His attorney argues that the incident took place after "several uninvited people entered the home" where Williams lives and began causing the disturbance.&nbsp;He is looking forward to defending the assault allegations against him, if necessary, according to the established procedures of law enforcement.</p><p>These legal troubles will effectively destroy his basketball career.
