While <a href=#><strong>Dune</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Shrek 2</strong></a> had solid recent runs, not to mention the ongoing re-release of every live-action Spider-Man movie, this past weekend saw the re-issue of <a href=#><strong>Ridley Scott</strong>’s <strong>Alien</strong></a> and director <strong>Stephen Sommers</strong>’ <a href=#><strong>The Mummy</strong></a>, which is <strong>celebrating its 25th anniversary this year</strong>. Whether we like it or not, millennials are now old enough to revisit childhood favorites in theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over 1,200 of them across North America played The Mummy<a href=#>this weekend</a>. Originally released in 1999, the film <strong>grossed a little over $1 million in three days</strong>, falling short of <a href=#>the $1.5 million that Alien made</a> from 1,700 nationwide theaters, and the $1.4 million that <a href=#>the Shrek 2 re-release</a> had generated in its first three days a couple of weeks ago. The Mummy’s <strong>cumulative global gross now stands at $417 million</strong>, with $156 million coming from domestic theaters. The film <strong>served as a reboot of <a href=#>the classic Universal Monsters franchise</a></strong>, and spawned two sequels and a spin-off before being rebooted itself several years later.</p><p>The film also cemented <a href=#><strong>Brendan Fraser</strong></a> as <strong>one of the biggest movie stars of the 1990s</strong>. Fraser experienced a bit of a career slump in the 2010s, before his grand rebound a couple of years ago with his Oscar-winning performance in <strong>Darren Aronofsky</strong>’s <a href=#><strong>The Whale</strong></a>. He reprized his role as the adventurer Rick O’Connell in 2001’s <a href=#><strong>The Mummy Returns</strong></a>, which was an even bigger hit with $435 million in global box office revenue. <a href=#>He played Rick one last time</a> in 2008’s <strong>The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</strong>, directed by <strong>Rob Cohen</strong>. The movie grossed $405 million worldwide. Sommers went on to direct big-budget films such as <strong>Van Helsing</strong> and <strong>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</strong>, but hasn’t directed a feature film in over a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>The Mummy Films</p></th><th scope=col><p>Global Box Office</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>The Mummy (1999)</p></td><td><p>$417 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Mummy Returns (2001)</p></td><td><p>$435 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008)</p></td><td><p>$405 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=fraser-39-s-three-39-mummy-39-movies-grossed-a-combined-total-of-1-2-billion-worldwide>Fraser's Three 'Mummy' Movies Grossed a Combined Total of $1.2 Billion Worldwide</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p><strong>The Mummy franchise was rebooted in 2017</strong>, with the ill-fated <a href=#><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a> vehicle of the same name. The film was designed to spawn a shared universe of Universal Monsters films, but its lukewarm box office — $410 million worldwide — and toxic reviews <a href=#>brought the entire franchise crashing down</a>. Universal pivoted to focusing on standalone director-driven projects in the aftermath of the Dark Universe’s failure; the studio tasted success with this strategy in early 2020, with <a href=#><strong>The Invisible Man</strong></a> reboot. Also starring <a href=#><strong>Rachel Weisz</strong></a>, <strong>John Hannah</strong>, and <strong>Arnold Vosloo</strong>, The Mummy is <strong>currently playing in theaters</strong>.
