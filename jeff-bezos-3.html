Following that, Bezos was elevated to the position of head of development, and then to the position of director of customer service.</p><p>Bezos had hoped to start an online store by the end of 1993. In the months before settling on Seattle, Bezos contemplated locating his company on a neighboring Indian reservation to avoid paying taxes. Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer. Website listings were alphabetized back then, which meant that a name starting with “A” would appear first in a search for a product or service by a customer.</p><p>As an additional point of clarification, he felt the name “Amazon,” which is taken from the world’s greatest river, was suitable for what he anticipated would be the world’s largest online bookstore. With the money he inherited from his parents, he made an estimated $300,000 investment in the online retailer Amazon.</p><p>Even though Amazon started as an online bookstore, founder Jeff Bezos had always planned to broaden the company’s services. Bezos went public with Amazon in an initial public offering (IPO) three years after the business was established (IPO).</p><p>After raising $54 million via the company’s 1997 public offering, Bezos put the money to use to finance an aggressive acquisition plan. In 2000, when the firm’s financial reserves had fallen to just $350 million, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks to keep the company afloat. Founded in 2002, Amazon Web Services collected data from weather channels and internet traffic to provide customers with better service.</p><p>Amazon’s rapid spending caused the business to go into financial difficulties in late 2002 when sales slowed to a crawl. In 2003, Amazon was able to turn a profit of $400 million after going through a period of financial turbulence. Amazon Kindle was launched by Jeff Bezos in November 2007.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeff_Bezos_Net_Worth_Summary></span><span id=Jeff_Bezos_Net_Worth_Summary>Jeff Bezos Net Worth Summary</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2023, Jeff Bezos’s net worth is $114 Billion.
