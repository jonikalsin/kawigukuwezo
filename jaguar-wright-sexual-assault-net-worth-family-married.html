I was on stage all night and I wanna lay down.’ I lay down on the bed with all my clothes on — I’m a rape survivor. I know how to buy myself a little time just in case a ni**a try to get out of hand. You gotta pull my pants down and by the time you get my pants down, I promise you I’m booking off in your jaw."</strong></span></p><p><span>Furthermore, she spoke:</span></p><p><span><strong>"The next thing I know I’m waking up in the morning and I feel something poking in my face and s**t … I open my mouth and this ni**a tried to stick his dick in my mouth while I’m asleep. Lonnie f****ng&nbsp;Lynn, Rashid, Common — whatever the f**k you want to call yourself. That’s why I stopped f****n’ with him, because ni**a if you gonna try to stick your dick in my mouth while I’m asleep, there ain’t nothing you won’t do.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Jaguar Wright also posted the 59-minute long video on her Instagram, where she mentioned the unexpected moment. She captioned the clip with a statement, <strong>'Let's<span> keep it a Bean! I'm tired of all the lies and disrespect! Boom!'</span></strong></span></p><p><span>Wright then went on stating:</span></p><p><strong><span>"He ain't been right since Lauryn Hill left him anyway. Then he got with Erykah [Badu] after I f---ing spurned him. He hated my ex-husband for I don't know how long… real b---h s--t. Then Erykah was jealous as f**k of me. That song 'Booty' on that second album, that s--t was about me."</span></strong></p><p><span>Despite the accusation of sexual misconduct, rapper Common has not responded to anything, as of yet.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Jaguar Wright's Net Worth</strong></span></h2><p><span>Jaguar Wright garners her net worth from her professional career as a singer.
