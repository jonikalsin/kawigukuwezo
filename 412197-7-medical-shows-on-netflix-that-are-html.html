However, some of the best medical shows have added a personal touch to their hospital sets by telling the fictional stories of doctors and nurses to pull at the heartstrings.</p><p class=dh>While most people come for the drama and the shock factor of medical tragedies and emergencies, it is believed that the popularity of medical shows can be boiled down to an audience's desire to watch stories about people.</p><p class=dh>According to George Ikkos, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine's psychiatry department, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbr.com/medical-dramas-work-audiences/>medical shows</a> like "Casualty" are both dramatic and exciting while also being relatable through character development. So, without further ado, here are seven of the best <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thecinemaholic.com/reality-medical-shows-on-netflix/>medical series</a> on Netflix.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Life'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In light of the rise of South Korea's influence in the entertainment industry, "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8243158/>Life</a>" offers fans of medical shows a great South Korean option.
