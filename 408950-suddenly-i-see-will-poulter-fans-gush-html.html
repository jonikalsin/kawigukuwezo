In June, he attended Dior Homme Spring 2024's Mens Collection Fashion Show in Paris with a new look that fans could not get over.</p><p class=dh>The actor looked stylish in a white collared shirt, light taupe trousers, and a brown tie-dye coat hanging over his shoulder. However, fans noticed his facial hair more, which added character and masculinity to his appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/aeb9100c94a0be64c603f2b45e040fdaecea10aeec366e4a6167098502b2faac.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Will Poulter on April 27, 2023, in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Poulter's supporters took their thoughts to social media, praising the actor for his new look. One fan even made a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/fatfabfeminist/status/1677547359922790402>collage</a> of his poses with facial hair, starting a thread of reactions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7d65bab9a7d518fc7f7e1af19225fe7bbbf01de81caeb040d57b3b6305a554d1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Will Poulter attends the Dior Homme Spring 2024 Menswear Collection Fashion Show at the Military School on June 23, 2023, in Paris, France. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>"He's so precious and kind that it just makes him even more attractive," one tweet <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/deburtheworst/status/1677666951894560770>read</a>. Meanwhile, a second fan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Andr3w_Ezz/status/1677827832037138432>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Call me the opening montage of 'The Devil Wears Prada' because SUDDENLY I see!"</p><p class=dh>Another fan mistook Poulter for professional dancer and actor, Derek Hough, noting that they now have a strong resemblance. "So similar," the fan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Khaleesi_Magica/status/1677806899255713792>said</a>. A fourth fan shared a meme of a rat staring at something alongside the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/allstarswamp/status/1677703411922268160>caption</a>, "I need him."</p><p class=dh>This isn't the first time Poulter became a topic of conversation for his looks. In a previous <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/gq-hype-will-poulter>interview</a>, the actor revealed he was mistaken for the boy from "Toy Story" at a Los Angeles urinal. Although the Pixar film was animated, Poulter didn't want to be rude and didn't react much.</p><p class=dh>He also shared that he became a meme online, dressed up as "Toy Story" character Sid. Poulter's photo was used for an anti-bullying week campaign. Interestingly, "Toy Story" came out when he was only two.</p><p class=dh>While some may see a resemblance between Poulter and the animated character, many are head over heels for the heartthrob, including his previous girlfriends. Unfortunately, Poulter doesn't talk much about his romantic life, wanting to keep it private.</p><p class=dh>However, the actor was spotted hanging out with model and actress Bobby T in August 2022, sparking dating rumors. The pair were also seen showing physical affection and locking lips.</p><p class=dh>Before Bobby T, <a class="me a" href=#>Will Poulter</a> was rumored to be dating his "Midsommar" co-star, <a class="me a" href=#>Florence Pugh</a>.
