In 2016 an Indiana man found a two-headed timber rattlesnake, the same kind of snake as Deuce, on his property in Monroe County.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Tony Moore, he had built his home in the middle of a rattlesnake den. He noticed one night that a pair of the rattlesnakes were moving slowly and hanging around his front yard. On closer inspection, he realized it was actually one snake with two heads.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-130721 alt="Deuce The Snake" width=640 height=360 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/deuce-the-snake.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-130721 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Mark Young’s Facebook page&nbsp;</span><span class=caption-body>“Deuce” when he was first discovered.</span></p><p>“I was awestruck. I had to get very close to make sure. And then when I realized each of the two heads occasionally had a tongue come out and were fully functional, I realized I wasn’t seeing things,” Moore said. “I’d have to say it’s a one-in-a-million situation. I’ve never seen a two-headed anything except in a museum. I mean I guess it’s fortunate. It’s amazing.”</p><p>Though they are not the only animals who can be born with two heads, snakes are the most common “polycephalic” animals (animals with two heads).</p><p>Enjoyed that?
