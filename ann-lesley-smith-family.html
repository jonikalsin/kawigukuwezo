The former couple got married on August 24, 1985.</p><p>Ann's marriage to John immediately brought her into the elite class. She left her job as a dental hygienist as money was no longer a concern with her new family.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, Smith became accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle that included buying designer clothes, horse rides, and expensive cars.
