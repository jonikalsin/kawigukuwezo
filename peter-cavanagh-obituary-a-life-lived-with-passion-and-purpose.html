The members of our club would like to express their sympathies to the Castleton bowling club, as well as to Betty and the rest of the family circle, during this trying time. On a more personal note, I will never forget Peter (and Betty), since I started my career as a bowler when I was 12 years old in the old “AFM B” Indoor Bowling Club, which, oddly enough, played its matches at the old Castleton Bowling Club.</p><p>Peter was one of the first people I ever met while I was bowling, and Betty was one of the first people I ever met. Peter was one of the first individuals I ever bowled with, and Betty was also one of the first people I bowled with at any point in my life. When I first started bowling, Peter and Betty were two of the first people I ever spoke to, and neither one of them is someone I will ever forget.</p><p>They are going to leave an indelible mark on my mind for a very long time. They shown an interest in learning, and they were always willing to instruct and assist others. They were without a doubt of assistance to me and contributed to my accomplishments as I progressed further in my bowling career. Even if there wasn’t much of an interest in younger bowlers back then, those people still had an interest in the sport, and they were always ready to offer advice and assistance to anyone who required it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwvMStnKtlk5bDorrAoJ9mp5Kewbat0bJkmmWcnrOmecuirZ6cXay2tbSMqZisq5mku26tzZ1kqa2ipby0sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
