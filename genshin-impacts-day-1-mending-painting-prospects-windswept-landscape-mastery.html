Of all the other activities on offer at this event, the Mending Painting Prospects mini-game stands out as an absolute gem. Assisting the ambitious painter Batlo in his endeavour to restore the charm of old paintings that have been ruined by time is what this creative journey is all about. Throughout the first day of the event, this all-inclusive guide will be your reliable companion as we work with Batlo to restore the splendour of these priceless works of art.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=h-exploring-the-mending-painting-prospects-event><strong>Exploring the Mending Painting Prospects Event</strong></h2><p>During the Mending Painting Prospects event, players can collaborate with Batlo, an NPC painter, to revitalise ancient paintings in this engaging picture-matching minigame. This artistic endeavour gives the expansive world of Genshin Impact a new depth and gives players a different viewpoint on the game’s magical vistas.</p><h2><strong>Day 1 – Unraveling the Windswept Landscape</strong></h2><p>On the first day of the event, players are required to visit three different locations: “The City of Wine and Song,” “Winery’s Leisurely Relaxation,” and “Great Dragon’s Residence.”</p><h2><strong>The City of Wine and Song</strong></h2><p>We are taken to the Church of Favonius and the magnificent Anemo Archon statue at our first stop. Go up to the roof of the Knights of Favonius headquarters in Mondstadt to recapture the spirit of this picture. It is your task to bring the face of the Anemo Archon in the artwork into line with the real statue. A flurry of yellow circles will indicate that you have successfully found the exact angle. Remember to take a thoughtfully composed picture to immortalise this moment.</p><h2><strong>Winery’s Leisurely Relaxation</strong></h2><p>You will want to head east of Mondstadt to the Dawn Winery for the second phase of our tour. The main goal is to align the Dawn Winery building’s architectural elements with those depicted in the painting. Reaching this may require a little accuracy, but if everything lines up perfectly, you’ll be able to capture the spirit of the moment with ease.</p><p>Taking a minute to ponder is necessary for the second aspect of this location, which involves lining up your camera with the cliff formations on the right. You will be able to catch the elusive beauty of the absent scenery by deftly changing your point of view.</p><h2><strong>Great Dragon’s Residence</strong></h2><p>Arriving in Stormterror’s Lair in Mondstadt is the third and last destination. Place the painting’s depicted tower dome in line with its real-world equivalent to begin your journey. As soon as you get this section captured, shift your focus to the body of water depicted in the piece and line it up with the main structure of rocks. To finally balance the artwork and the broken structure, move the focus of your camera to the right. With this final image, all of the highlighted artworks from Day 1 have triumphantly been restored.</p><h2><strong>Reaping the Rewards</strong></h2><p>Enrolling in the Mending Painting Prospects event will not only provide you with the chance to explore the fascinating landscapes of Mondstadt and Liyue, but it will also provide substantial benefits. You can gather Primogems, Mora, and various talent level-up materials on the first day if you work hard to complete every task.</p><p>Join Batlo as they go on their creative journey to bring the historical treasures that adorn the realm of Genshin Impact back to life. As you set out on this picturesque excursion, Day 1 is waiting for your sharp eye and photography prowess.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;Best PC Settings for EA Sports FC 24: Optimize Your Gaming Experience</p><p>Overwatch 2 Season 7 Battle Pass Revealed: Premium Skins, Events, and Rewards</p><p>Overwatch 2 Season 7 Hero Updates: Exciting Changes Await Competitive Gamers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnl5q7tLTIp2SipaCWsLW%2FjJ2YsmVhYrqmusOipaBloJa2r8DIp55mqKKkwLGxwq2qZq%2BZo7G0w8Spq2akkaOxtK%2FAqZxmpZGowaa%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
